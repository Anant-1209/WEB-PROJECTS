        A little knowledge is a dangerous thing, has been aptly said by Alexander Pope. This is true of people living in all the ages, because real learning and wisdom does not come to all. There are many who love to blow their own trumpet with their half baked and fanciful ideas. In the realm of education too, people may be called literate but whether they are truly educated, is a subject which calls for deep concern and contemplation. However we are not left without hope because still there are many educational institutions which are committed to educating and grooming individuals.

One such institution is Rani Laxmi Bai Group of Public schools, which was established by Dr. Pandit Vishwanath Sharma. Inspired by the ideals and values of his father – Vaidya (Pt.) Ram Narayan Sharma, Dr. Sharma laid down the foundation of Rani Laxmi Bai Public School, Jhansi in 1983. In 1992, Rani laxmi Bai Public school was set up at Datia and to follow it closely, was the establishment of Rani Laxmi Bai Public School at Lalitpur in 1993.

With English as the medium of instruction, the three schools have emphasized on imparting quality education to the students by developing scientific temperament and modern outlook, and yet retaining the cultural values and the glorious tradition of the country.

Initially, RLPS, Jhansi had only thirty students and five members of staff, which has now risen to over two thousand & five hundred students and two hundred & fifteen members of staff. The school at the onset, was a primary school only but by 1989, it had gone upto standard VII. By 1995, the scenario was very heartening as the first batch of std. XII was ready to appear for the first Board Examination. So far, sixteen batches for I.S.C. and twenty batches for I.C.S.E. have appeared for their respective board examinations. The brilliant results at both the levels has facilitated the selection of students in several Medical, Engineering and varied professional courses over the years.

A very striking and exclusive feature of RLPS, Jhansi is the boarding facility for boys, which has proved to be very profitable for the students. In 1992, the concept of a Boys Hostel, became a veritable reality, and ever since then, there has been no looking back. All possible comforts have gone into making the hostel a home away from home.

Board results at both the I.C.S.E. and I.S.C. levels are a culmination of the resolute and unflinching efforts of both the teachers and the students. 100% results have been consistently accomplished for 10 years at ISC level and 9 years at ICSE level.  The board results of Rani Laxmibai Public School, Jhansi has been cent percent with 100% result in ISC (Class-XII Sc.) students scored 60% & above, In ISC (Class–XII Comm.) 92.86% students scored 60% & above. In (class- X) ICSE 96.70% students scored first division & above.  This year 91 students appeared in class XII and 182 students appeared in class X.

In the Board exams Shivani Agarwal of (Class-X) scored in ICSE (95.71%), Utkarsh Rawat of (Class-XII Sc.) scored in ISC (93.17%) and Akanksha Agarwal of (Class-XII Comm.) scored 93.50% securing highest aggregate percentage.

All the students of class XII (Sc) have secured I Division and the same has been secured by 176 viz. 96.70% students of class X. In class X, 71.98% students and in class XII, 67.03% students have secured 75% or more marks. Apoorv Aggarwal of class XII (Comm.) has secured hundred percent marks in Maths, whereas three students of class X have secured cent percent marks in Computer Applications. 8 students of class X have secured 100% marks in Environmental Science.
